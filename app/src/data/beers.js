        "Arcobräu is a brewery in the Lower Bavarian town of Moos. It is owned by the Arco-Zinneberg family. With a production of about 140,000 hectoliters of beer a year, the brewery is one of the larger breweries in Lower Bavaria. The former Schlossbrauerei Moos was first documented in 1567, but it was not until the merger of the various family-owned breweries in 1960 that today&#39;s company Arcobräu with its headquarters in Moos was built. In the early 1990s, Arcobräu took over a number of smaller breweries in Eastern Bavaria. Since 1974, Arcobräu hosts its own folk festival every Whitsun, widely known as the Mooser Pentecost in the region. In addition, Arcobräu since 1922 at the second largest Bavarian folk festival, the Gäubodenvolksfest in Straubing represented. At the end of 2010, a dispute between Arcobräu and the city of Deggendorf began, which had ignited the question of an additional marquee at the Deggendorfer Volksfest and culminated in allegations of corruption against local elected officials. This dispute, referred to by the regional media as a &quot;beer war&quot;, continued in the first half of 2011 and also found supraregional attention. In March 2016, the Arcobräu took over the castle brewery Irlbach.",
